# xor-neural-network

This code is based on Trask's tutorial here: [https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/](https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/). It is used for Ms. Pries' Applied Math and Artificial Intelligence class. You can find the curriculum [here](https://github.com/MsPries/AI-curriculum).

- basic_neural.py has output directly correlated to the first input
- xor_starter.py provides scaffolding to follow Trask's tutorial
- xor.py contains a fully functioning example
